# SPACE BROS

## Description

SPACE BROS was created by TNT Cat, a group of developers currently studying in CITM. We are María Calle, Irene Hernández and Paula Hitz. 

SPACE BROS is about two aliens that lost their home and need to find a new one. You must help them find it across the universe by scanning each planet and checking if they're habitable!

Watch out for your spaceship's battery and fuel: the battery depends on the time, and the fuel on the movement. Also watch out for asteroids :D
